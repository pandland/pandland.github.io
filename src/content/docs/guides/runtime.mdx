### Runtime.pid

### Runtime.version

Returns PandJS's version as a string - [semantic version](https://semver.org/) prefixed with `v` (for example `"v1.0.0"`)

### Runtime.argv

Returns the script arguments (as an array of strings) to the program.

```sh

```

```js
Runtime.argv.forEach(item => {
  console.log(`Arg: ${item}`);
});

Arg arg2
...

```

### Runtime.cwd()

Returns current working directory as a string.

```js

```

### Runtime.exit()

Forcefully exits process without waiting for pending operations.

```js
Runtime.exit(1) // exit process with status 1 (error)
```

### Runtime.sleep()

Pauses the execution of the main thread for the specified number of milliseconds.

<Aside type='caution'>
This method **literally** pauses exection of the main thread and event loop too.
Everything will be frozen, even your timers set by `setTimeout` so execution of timers will be delayed.
</Aside>

```js
Runtime.sleep(2000)
```
