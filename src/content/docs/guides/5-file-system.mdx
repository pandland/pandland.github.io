PandJS has a limited set of APIs for reading and writing files.
All function are heavily inspired by POSIX-like APIs.

<Aside type='caution'> 
Behavior may vary across platforms; check compatibility and test accordingly to ensure consistent results.
</Aside>

### Open file

Open and possibly create a file. The exact behavior depends on the flags provided.
Returns `FileHandle` class instance.

> Check [open(2)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/open.2.html) for more details.

```js
import { open, O_WRONLY, O_CREAT } from 'std:fs';

// will open file as "write-only", if does not exist - create new file.
const file = await open("./sample.txt", O_WRONLY | O_CREAT);
```

You can also pass `mode` parameter to `open` function:

```js
const file = await open("./sample.txt", O_RDWR, 0666);
```

<Aside>
Non-absolute paths are resolved relative to **cwd** (current working directory).
</Aside>

Available open flags:

- **O_CREAT**: Creates the file if it does not already exist.
- **O_RDONLY**: Opens the file in read-only mode, allowing data to be read but not written.
- **O_WRONLY**: Opens the file in write-only mode, allowing data to be written but not read.
- **O_APPEND**: Opens the file in append mode, with all writes added to the end of the file.
- **O_EXCL**: Ensures that the file is created exclusively; used with O_CREAT, it will cause an error if the file already exists.
- **O_RDWR**: Opens the file in read-write mode, allowing both reading from and writing to the file.
- **O_TRUNC**: Truncates the fileâ€™s content to zero length if it already exists and is opened in write or read-write mode.

### Reading bytes from file

This snippet demonstrates the read method by reading up to `1024` bytes from an already-opened file into a buffer.
The `read` method returns number of bytes actually read. 
The read method is asynchronous, so it returns the data only once the reading process is complete.

> Check [read(2)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html) for more details.

```js
import { open, O_RDONLY } from 'std:fs';

const file = await open("./sample.txt", O_RDONLY);
const buf = new Buffer(1024);
const size = await file.read(buf);
console.log('size:', size);
console.log(buf);

await file.close();
```

### Writing bytes to file

Write method will try to write whole provided buffer to the file.
Returns actually written bytes, so partial writes are possible - make sure you check
if everything is written.

> Check [write(2)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/write.2.html) for more details.

```js
import { open, O_WRONLY, O_CREAT } from 'std:fs';

const file = await open("./sample.txt", O_WRONLY | O_CREAT);
const buf = Buffer.from("Hello from write()");
const size = await file.write(buf);
console.log('size:', size);
console.log(buf);

await file.close();
```

### Close file

Close every file when all operations are completed.
If you forget to close file, it will lead to resource leak.

> Check [close(2)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/close.2.html) for more details.

```js
...
await file.close();
```
