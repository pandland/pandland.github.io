You can schedule specific callbacks using timer functions that are available globally.

### setTimeout

Sometimes you might want to delay the execution of a function - you can use `setTimeout` for this task.

```js
setTimeout(() => {
  // runs once after 2 seconds
}, 2000);

setTimeout(() => {
  // runs once after 50 milliseconds
}, 50);
```

### setInterval

This function is similar to `setTimeout`, but runs repeatedly. 

```js
setInterval(() => {
  // runs every 3 seconds
}, 3000);
```

### clearInterval and clearTimeout

Sometimes you may want to cancel timers - you can easily do it with `clearInterval` and `clearTimeout`.

Both `setInterval` and `setTimeout` return numerical ID and we can use them to clear specific timers.

```js
const id = setInterval(() => {
  console.log('Interval callback')
}, 3000);

clearInterval(id);
```

<Aside>
It's worth noting that the pool of IDs used by `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()` are shared, which means you can technically use `clearTimeout()` and `clearInterval()` interchangeably. However, for clarity, you should avoid doing so.
