title: Modules
description: Get started with PandJS
---

PandJS supports only ES6 modules. CommonJS support is not planned at all.

### Standard library

PandJS exposes modules for interacting with operating system resources like files, sockets etc.
Every built-in module is prefixed with `std:`.

This is example how to import modules from the standard library:

```js
import { uuidv4 } from 'std:uuid'

console.log(uuidv4());
```

### Get meta data of current module

Sometimes you may want to meta data like URL, filename of current module.
You can find it inside `import.meta` object, which looks like:

```js
{
  url: 'file:///home/johndoe/Workspace/hello/sample.js',
  filename: '/home/johndoe/Workspace/hello/sample.js',
  dirname: '/home/johndoe/Workspace/hello',
  main: false,
  resolve: [Function]
}
```
